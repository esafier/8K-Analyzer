You are analyzing an SEC 8-K filing to determine if it describes a significant executive or compensation event.

Decide if this filing is about ANY of the following:
- An executive departure, resignation, retirement, or termination
- A new executive hire or appointment (CEO, CFO, COO, President, Board member, etc.)
- A compensation event: inducement award, accelerated vesting, severance package, employment agreement, equity grant, or major comp plan change

If the filing is relevant, classify it and write a short summary.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "relevant": true or false,
  "category": "Management Change" or "Compensation" or "Both" or null,
  "subcategory": one of ["CEO Departure", "CFO Departure", "COO Departure", "Executive Departure", "New Hire", "Inducement Award", "Accelerated Vesting", "Comp Plan Change", "Severance / Separation"] or null,
  "summary": "2-3 sentence plain English summary of what happened, including names and titles if mentioned" or null
}

If the filing is NOT relevant (e.g., it's about a routine business agreement, real estate lease, or other non-executive event), set relevant to false and all other fields to null.
